  example `example.com/elasticsearch` ([#19](https://github.com/cars10/elasticvue/issues/19))

## 0.20.0

This version removes the need to configure CORS **if you use one of the browser extensions**. I am not entirely happy
with this change, but after some discussion ([#14](https://github.com/cars10/elasticvue/issues/14], [#17][p17)) i think
we i should prioritize usability in this
case.

**You still have to configure CORS if you use the docker image or the web version of elasticvue.**
